    "options": {
      "A": "Balls are placed equal distances apart on the floor to represent electrons dispersed throughout a uniform positive medium represented by the floor. The balls represent the gold particles that deflect the alpha particles.",
      "B": "Several balls are clustered together on the floor to represent protons and neutrons in the gold atom nucleus. The nucleus is circled with multiple rings of string to represent the various orbitals' energy levels from which the electrons were ejected by the alpha particles.",
      "C": "Balls are taped to the classroom floor about 2 m apart. Pieces of string are used to shape the outlines of s and p orbitals on the floor around the balls. Two small pieces of rolled-up tape are placed inside each orbital to represent electrons. The orbital shapes represent where the gold electrons are located when they interact with the alpha particles.",
      "D": "Some balls are suspended about 2 m above the floor and 2 m apart in a straight line across the room to represent the gold atoms' nuclei in the foil. Students take turns throwing the other balls at the suspended balls and count the number of times a suspended ball is hit or missed. The hits represent deflection of the alpha particles by the gold nuclei."
